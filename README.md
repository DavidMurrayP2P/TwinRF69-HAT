You can find the user docs, showing you how to get started with the Photon Power Zero, and the design decisions around the board here:

The they operate as stackable hearders for the raspberrp Pi. This si designed aronud relative low power and potentially solar, battery operation and integration with the  [Photon Power Zero](https://youtu.be/pwCCnsn2Mug) video..</p>

As an open-source project, you can find the code for the Twin RF69, the Kicad PCB files and the FDM 3D printing files below
